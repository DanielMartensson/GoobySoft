# GoobySoft

This is a measuring and controlling software. The purpose of this software is to provide an open source measurement software and control software that is easy to maintain and easy to use. 

This software is a long time development project. Here I upload the communication protocols such as `Modbus`, `CANopen`, `SAE-J1939` etc. so they can be used to communicate with different industrial devices.

The project is written in C++20 and it's using `ImGui` as graphics library.
